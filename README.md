# NumaMMa: Numa MeMory Analyzer 

NumaMMa is both a NUMA memory profiler/analyzer and a NUMA application execution engine. The profiler allows to run an application while gathering information about memory accesses. The analyzer visually reports information about the memory behavior of the application allowing to identify memory access patterns. Based on the results of the analyzer, the execution engine is capable of executing the application in an efficient way by allocating memory pages in a clever way.

## Dependencies

NumaMMa relies on the following libraries:

- `numactl`
- `numap`
- `backtrace`
- `libelf`

## Build

The above dependencies must be installed first. Then NumaMMa itself can be built.

You can also run the `install_everything.sh` script that installs NumaMMa and its dependencies. You can also run the following commands to download and build NumaMMa with all its dependencies.

## Profiling an application

To profile your application with NumaMMa, just launch it through the `numamma` command installed when NumaMMa has been built:

```bash
numamma [options] myappli      
```

`numamma` gathers information on the memory objects of the application (ie. global variables, or dynamically allocated buffers), and samples the application memory access.

The following options permit to customize how `numamma` collects data:

- `-aINTERVAL` or `--alarm=INTERVAL`
  + Collect samples every `INTERVAL` ms (default: disabled)
  
- `-f` or `--flush[=yes|no]`
  + Flush the sample buffer when full (default: yes)
  
- `-r` or `--sampling-rate=RATE`
  + Set the sampling rate (default: 10000)

- `-s` or `--buffer-size=SIZE`
  + Set the sample buffer size (default: 128 KB per thread)
  + When the sample buffer is full, numamma stop recording memory access until the buffer is emptied. The buffer is emptied when the application calls an allocation function (eg. malloc, realloc, free, etc.), when the alarm is triggered (if set), or when the buffer becomes full (unless the `--flush=no` option is passed to `numamma`)


### NumaMMA report

At the end of the execution, NumaMMa reports information about the memory accesses of the application:

74698 samples (including 1905 samples that do not match a known memory buffer / 2.550269%)
Output directory: /tmp/numamma_trahay
```

Additionally, `numamma` also generates files in the /tmp/numamma_$USER directory. To control which files are generated, several options are available:

- by default, `numamma` generates `call_sites.log` that lists the application memory objects as well as memory access statistics on them. Each line starts with the call site ID. For example:

```
3       /home/trahay/Soft/opt/numamma/test/mat_mul.c:74(main) (size=12000) - 160 buffers. 5498814 read access (total weight: 1305315950, avg weight: 237.381361). 40590 wr_access
4       /home/trahay/Soft/opt/numamma/test/mat_mul.c:78(main) (size=12000) - 339 buffers. 5818196 read access (total weight: 1088387205, avg weight: 187.066095). 14656019 wr_access
5       /home/trahay/Soft/opt/numamma/test/mat_mul.c:76(main) (size=12000) - 1 buffers. 10830555 read access (total weight: 80991250, avg weight: 7.478033). 0 wr_access
2       /home/trahay/Soft/opt/numamma/test/mat_mul.c:70(main) (size=12000) - 38 buffers. 6873841 read access (total weight: 58451985, avg weight: 8.503540). 40590 wr_access
6       /home/trahay/Soft/opt/numamma/test/mat_mul.c:72(main) (size=12000) - 1 buffers. 6453238 read access (total weight: 52071167, avg weight: 8.068998). 0 wr_access
7       /home/trahay/Soft/opt/numamma/test/mat_mul.c:68(main) (size=12000) - 1 buffers. 6836348 read access (total weight: 48885993, avg weight: 7.150893). 0 wr_access
1       [stack] (size=412316860415) - 1 buffers. 1819616 read access (total weight: 14471352, avg weight: 7.952970). 4946 wr_access
```

- by default, `numamma` also generates an access summary file (named `callsite_counters_<ID>.dat`)for each call site. For example, `callsite_counters_3.dat` contains the access summary for the callsite `3` (`mat_mul.c:74(main)`):

```
        58570   0       5352336 58
        58570   0       0       0
        27042   0       42828   0
```
  + this file contains the number of memory accesses to an object. Each line contains the accesses to a page within the object (assuming 4KiB pages), and the columns corresponds to the different threads.

  

- `-d` or `--dump`
  + Dump the collected memory access (default: disabled)
  + When this option is enabled, numamma reports in `callsite_dump_<ID>.dat` all the samples collected for each call site. For instance:

```
#thread_rank timestamp offset mem_level access_weight
0 14087247746057 5864 L1_Hit 0
0 14087248615826 3872 L1_Hit 0
0 14087249526638 1888 L1_Hit 0
0 14087250387561 7912 L1_Hit 0
0 14088660667040 5776 L3_Hit 50
0 14088923322555 6376 L2_Hit 46
```

    + `thread_rank` is the thread that performed the memory access
    + `timestamp` is the date at which the memory access occured
    + `offset` is the part of the memory object that was accessed
    + `mem_level` is the part of the memory hierarchy that was accessed
    + `access_weight` is the 'cost' of the memory access. This is (more or less) the number of CPU cycles that were required for this memory access


  + When the `-d` option is enabled, numamma also writes a summary of the memory access to a memory object in `callsite_summary_<ID>.dat`. For example:

```
# --------------------------------------
# Summary of all the read memory access:
# Total count          :         6265665
# Total weigh          :         499271856

```

- `-m` or `--match-samples[=yes|no]`
  + Match samples with the corresponding memory object (default: yes)
  + By default, numamma tried to find the memory object that corresponds to each collected sample. This option can be used in order to reduce the analysis cost.

- `-o` or `--outputdir=dir`
  + Specify the directory where files are written (default: `/tmp/numamma_$USER`)

- `--online-analysis`
  + Analyze samples at runtime (default: disabled)
  + By default, the samples are stored in buffers at runtime, and analyzed at the end of the application. This may cause numamma to allocate a lot of memory for storing samples.
  + When this option is enabled, the samples are analyzed at runtime and are not stored. This prevents numamma from allocated to much memory, but this increases numamma overhead at runtime.

- `-u` or `--dump-unmatched`
  + Dump the samples that did not match a memory object (default: disabled)
  + When this option is enabled, numamma writes the addresses that did not match any memory object in `unmatched_samples.log`.

- `-n` or `--no-dump-single-items`
  + When this option is enabled, do not dump the per callsite summary, per callsite dump, nor per callsite counter (default: disabled)

### Plotting data

The data produced by NumaMMA at runtime can be plotted using R scripts:

- `plot_pages_matrix.R`
  + this script takes a `callsite_counters_X.dat` as a parameter and generates a matrix plot that represent the number of memory access that each thread issued to each pages of an object
  Usage: `plot_pages_matrix.R callsite_counters_1.dat` generates `callsite_counters_1.dat.png`

- `plot_timeline`
  + this script takes a `callsite_dump_X.dat` file as a parameter and generates a timeline plot.
  Example of usage: `plot_timeline -i callsite_dump_1.dat -o callsite_dump_1.png`

- `plot_interactive_timeline.py`
  + this script takes a `callsite_dump_X.dat` file as a parameter and generates an interactive timeline plot.
  + Example of usage: `plot_interactive_timeline.py callsite_dump_1.dat`
